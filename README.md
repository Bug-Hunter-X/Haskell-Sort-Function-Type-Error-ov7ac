# Haskell Sort Function Type Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Haskell's Data.List.sort function. The code appears straightforward but can lead to a runtime exception if the input list contains elements of incompatible types.

The `bug.hs` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version, addressing type safety using more specific types.

This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in Haskell to avoid runtime surprises.
